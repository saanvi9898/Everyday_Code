Principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

1. Class:
A class is a user-defined data type that contains attributes (variables) and methods (functions) in one place.

📌 Syntax:
class ClassName:
    # attributes
    # methods

2. Object:
An object is an instance of a class. It is used to access the data and behavior that is defined in the class.

📌 Syntax:
class Dog:
    pass

d1 = Dog()   # d1 is an instance (object) of class Dog

📘 Word Meaning:
Instance → An object created from a class

📝 In Simple Words:
Class   = Design / Blueprint  
Object  = Real item made from that design  
Instance/Object = The real item created from the class
